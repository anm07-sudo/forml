        <p>My dear, sweet boyfriend,</p>
        <p>
            While today is not an important day to you, it's an important day to me. 
            It's the day you came to life, and while to you that is not something to celebrate, I want to celebrate it in secret because
            the fact that you exist made it so that eventually I can meet you. And I am so grateful for that.
        </p>
        <p>
            I made you a promise that I will not do anything special for you today, but I made you promise that on my birthday too. 
            I guess we both broke our promises, but I hope that this gift is something that will make you smile a bit, and that you will cherish.
            You told me before that your birthdays were always treated as if they were insignificant, not something to celebrate. 
            But, I believe you should be celebrated because you deserve it. You deserve to be loved and cherished every day, not just on your birthday.
            You are such an amazing person, and I am so lucky to have you in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are so intelligent, and kind, with a handsome face, and a hot body ðŸ˜‚. But really, you are a hard-worker, and you are strategic
            which is something I respect about you so much. You are always thinking ahead, and you are always trying to improve yourself.
            And you make calculated decisions, you keep to yourself, and you are not afraid to speak your mind. I remember from when we first
            started talking, and from when I started to get to know you, that you were kind of lying to me about everything, but the more you met me,
            and the more you trusted me, you started to share little things with me, and they meant the world to me because it showed me you trust me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I love every single thing about you, from the way you talk, to the way you laugh, to your smile, to your deepest, darkest thoughts, to your scars.
            There's not a single thing that I do not love about you. You are my everything, and I am so grateful to have you in my life. 
            You are so educated, and funny, and gentle, and so incredibly strong. You are determined, and I love how you take care of yourself.
            You workout, and you eat healthy, and you study, and you work, and you do everything you can to be the best version of yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
            The list of how much I love you, or what I love about you is endless, but I want you to know that I love you more than anything in this world, 
            and I would do anything for you. I would give up everything for you, and I would protect you from any harm coming your way. I want to protect your 
            kind heart for the rest of my life, and that is a promise I want to make to you, that for as long as you will let me, I will protect you and your
            soul with everything in my power.
        </p>
        <p>
            And if it means anything to you, just know that I am yours forever ðŸ’–
            You mean the world to me, and you have helped me in so many ways. Every day when I wake up I think about you and you help me become a better
            version of myself simply by the fact that you exist and you are so amazing, and I want to be the best version of myself for you.
            And I love listening to you, all day, every day, I just love your voice, your laugh, your thoughts, your way of loving, and your way of being.
            I want to be around you all the time, which is probably unrealistic, but you are just so amazing.
        </p>

            So, my love, I hope you know that I love you more than anything in this world, and I wish I could be next to you today to hug you and kiss you,
            and spoil you, and see you smile, and be happy. But, I know that you are not a fan of celebrating your birthday, and I respect that.
            But one day, it will be your birthday, and I will make you a cake and I will give you a hug and a kiss. That's it, but I promise you that I will do that. I am an excellent baker you know ðŸ˜‚
        </p>
        <h6>Happy birthday, baby! May you have the best ordinary Tuesday of your life ðŸ˜˜</h6>
